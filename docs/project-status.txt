      * Movement handling for normal, stairs, and elevator modes
      * Conveyor belt detection and push effect
      * Stair zone detection and entry/exit
      * Death and respawn system with invulnerability
      * Visual feedback: dust particles, screen flash, tinting
    - Updated GameScene with proper Player integration:
      * Arrow keys + WASD input handling
      * Conveyor and stair collision checking
      * Pause system (P key) with overlay
      * Debug visualization (D key) showing all spawn points
      * Minimal HUD: lives (hearts), score, floor indicator
    - Visual polish:
      * Dust particle system for movement feedback
      * Screen shake on death
      * Camera flash effects (yellow for items, red for death)
      * Invulnerability flicker after respawn

[✓] PHASE 5: Elevators & Stairs Navigation (Commit: 6059db0)
    - Created src/systems/ElevatorSystem.js:
      * Manages elevator platforms (16x4 gray rectangles)
      * Handles elevator entry/exit with rider tracking
      * Smooth vertical movement at 40 px/s
      * Floor detection and snapping (4px tolerance)
      * getNearbyElevator() for proximity detection
    - Updated Player.js for elevator support:
      * enterElevator() - snaps to X, disables vertical collision
      * exitElevator() - re-enables collision
      * handleElevatorMovement() - uses climb animation
    - Enhanced stair movement in Player.js:
      * Diagonal movement (70% vertical, 40% horizontal speed)
      * Landing detection at top/bottom of stairs
      * Fall death when walking off mid-stair
      * Automatic floor snapping on exit
    - Updated GameScene.js:
      * Integrates ElevatorSystem
      * handleElevatorInput() - entry, movement, exit logic
      * handleStairInput() - refactored stair entry
      * Conveyor check disabled while on elevator/stairs

[✓] PHASE 6: Doors, Items & Mr. Angry (Commit: pending)
    - Created src/systems/DoorManager.js:
      * Manages 10 doors across 4 floors
      * Door state machine (CLOSED, OPENING, OPEN)
      * Randomized item placement (4 items in random doors)
      * Mr. Angry placed behind random door
      * Polly fixed at leftmost door on floor 3
      * Door open animation on SPACE key interaction

      * Awakens with dramatic effect (flash, shake)
      * Simple chase AI on same floor (full AI in Phase 7)
      * Collision with player triggers death
    - Updated GameScene.js:
      * Integrates DoorManager
      * handleDoorInput() for SPACE key interaction
      * Item collection with physics overlap
      * Mr. Angry spawning on door event
      * Enemy collision handling
    - Enhanced HUD:

Key Files Modified This Phase:
- src/systems/DoorManager.js (NEW - door and item management)
- src/entities/MrAngry.js (NEW - special triggered enemy)
- src/scenes/GameScene.js (MODIFIED - door/item/enemy integration)

Controls:
- Arrow Keys / WASD: Move player
- SPACE: Open door (when near)
- Up/Down near elevator: Enter elevator, move up/down
- Left/Right on elevator at floor: Exit elevator
- Up/Down near stairs: Enter stairs, move diagonally
- Left/Right at stair landing: Exit stairs
- P: Toggle pause
- D: Toggle debug visualization
- G: Go to Game Over (dev)
- M: Return to Menu (dev)

Test Commands:
- npm install    (install dependencies)
- npm run dev    (start dev server)
- npm run build  (production build)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT PHASE: Phase 7 - Enemy AI & Collisions
--------------------------------------------

Objective: Implement remaining enemies and pathfinding AI.

Tasks:
[ ] 7.1 Create src/entities/Enemy.js base class
[ ] 7.2 Create Inspector, Manager, Patron enemy types
[ ] 7.3 Implement src/systems/EnemyAI.js with waypoint pathfinding
[ ] 7.4 Enemies use elevators and stairs to navigate
[ ] 7.5 Enemies cannot use conveyor belts
[ ] 7.6 Enemy-player collision triggers death
[ ] 7.7 AI repath interval (500ms)

Verification Criteria:
- All 3 starting enemies spawn and pursue player
- Enemies use elevators and stairs to reach player's floor
- Enemies avoid conveyor belt
- Collision with any enemy triggers death
- Mr. Angry (from Phase 6) integrates with enemy system
